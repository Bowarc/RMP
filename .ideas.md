# Server
The server is the main app  
clients can control the server
Only one at the time


The server will have two key features
- A music player
- A downloader

Maybe could switch between some different implementations ? rodio is good, but is there other options ?


# Clients

Default clients are GUI, TUI, CLI

More ? there will be a client-creation kit in shared if anyone wants to create their own

The clients will use a command system to interact with the server

List of commands
Music player
- Queue music
- Pause / play
- Stop current
- Clear queue
- Get info about currently playing
- Get info about the queue

- move time slider? :)
- Go forward and back in queue

Downloader:
- Queue download
- Stop current
- Clear queue
- Fetch status of current
- Fetch stack status

Playlist manager
- ?


## GUI

Graphical ui to use, something like spotube

For libraries
- Egui could be nice but it's a bit too simple ?
- Iced wasn't fun to use
- A custom ggez ui impl could do the job but it's really overkill


## TUI

Something like https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui

For ui lib ratatui seems to be a good choice

## CLI
Input commands and exit asap

No specific lib needed


# Features


## Music Player

rodio


## Downloader
Downloaded files would be stored like this
- A .mp3 file or any other audio format, where the name would never be changed
- A .metadata or something like that, it would store the name, the author, (the length ?) and more usefull data about this song etc..


For networking, i will be using my own stream system https://github.com/Bowarc/Crates/tree/main/networking


## Ideas
Integration with spotify account to import playlists

Import custom audio files
