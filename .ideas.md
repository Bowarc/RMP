The server is the main app
Any client can control the server
Maybe event make a 3rd client that would be arg driven ? like `rmp --pause` etc..


Downloaded files would be stored like this
- A .mp3 file or any other audio format, where the name would never be changed
- A .metadata or something like that, it would store the name, the author, (the length ?) and more usefull data about this song etc..
